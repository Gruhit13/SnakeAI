Snake game playing AI using Deep-Q-Learning

This is the tensorflow implementation of Deep-Q-Learning algorithm to play Snake game using a simple Neural Network
architecture. 

Deep-q-Learning is an on policy algorithm. Much similar to a Q-table deep-q-learning algo lets a neural network understand 
a proper mapping of state towards highest reward giving action.
